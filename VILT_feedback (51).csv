Since I don&#039;t have administrator rights on my computer in my organization it&#039;s almost impossible to install anything in one day. Please highlight that this software should be installed on the main course page or send the email in advance
2) on the main page of the course it says that &quot;Basic Knowledge of Inspire and HyperWorks Pre- and Postprocessing beneficial but not necessary&quot; but one of the first slides of the first day presentation mentions that it&#039;s recommended to go to basic InspireMold class first. As a beginner in that area after this course I should say that this course should be labeled as advanced and recommended after a basic molding course because the teacher is not going too deep into molding process explanation
3) session splitting. Pace of the first session was too fast (also too many slides for 2 hour session) and we didn&#039;t have enough time to do the molding simulation exercise which is something I had trouble with when trying to do it on my own. I think the first part may be twice longer (2 sessions instead of 1). Pace of the last two sessions were quite normal
4) training material. Training materials for the last lesson during the training were not provided they were sent by email later and in video format which is not the most convenient format (pdf is more useful)",,"I liked it - just right."
